# \## ✨ Overview

# 

# \*\*Jovial\*\* is a full-stack music streaming platform built on the MERN stack that reimagines how people experience music — together. Beyond being a beautifully crafted personal player with a reel-style swipe interface, Jovial introduces two breakthrough features that no mainstream streaming platform has ever shipped properly:

# 

# | Feature | Status | Capability |

# |---|---|---|

# | 🟢 Reel-Style Player | Full Integration | Swipe to change tracks, full controls, lyrics overlay |

# | 🟢 Together Mode (Couple) | Full Integration | 2 people, 1 queue, real-time sync, shared controls |

# | 🟢 Listening Room | Full Integration | Group sessions, room creator controls, invite links |

# | 🟢 StereoLink (Device Sync) | Full Integration | 2 phones sync as stereo speakers over local network |

# | 🟢 Real-Time Chat in Rooms | Full Integration | In-session chat, emoji reactions, song requests |

# | 🟢 Personalised Discovery | Full Integration | Mood-based recommendations, listen history, smart queues |

# 

# Jovial is built for people who believe music is best when it's \*\*shared\*\* — whether that's two people falling asleep to the same playlist, a group of friends hosting a virtual DJ room, or two phones placed side by side turning any room into a speaker system.

# 

# \---

# 

# \## 🚀 Why Jovial?

# 

# \### The Problem

# 

# Music listeners today face a fragmented, isolating experience:

# 

# \- ❌ \*\*Streaming is solitary\*\* — Spotify's Group Session is clunky, limited, and requires Premium

# \- ❌ \*\*No real device sync\*\* — Bluetooth pairs to one device only; AirPlay is Apple-only

# \- ❌ \*\*Couple listening is an afterthought\*\* — No platform treats 2-person listening as a first-class feature

# \- ❌ \*\*Boring player UIs\*\* — Traditional list-style players lack the tactile, scroll-through-music joy

# \- ❌ \*\*Group rooms need a DJ\*\* — One person controls the queue and everyone else just follows

# 

# \### The Solution

# 

# Jovial acts as a \*\*social music layer\*\* on top of a world-class streaming player:

# 

# \- ✅ \*\*Reel-style music discovery\*\* — Swipe through tracks like scrolling a feed, feel the vibe before committing

# \- ✅ \*\*Together Mode\*\* — Two people listen with perfect millisecond-level sync, both can control playback

# \- ✅ \*\*Listening Rooms\*\* — Create a room, invite anyone, the creator holds the remote, everyone enjoys

# \- ✅ \*\*StereoLink\*\* — Two phones on the same Wi-Fi become left and right speakers of a virtual stereo system

# \- ✅ \*\*Built for mobile-first\*\* — Every gesture, every animation, every feature designed around mobile

# 

# > It's not just a music app. It's a \*\*shared listening experience\*\*.

# 

# This is the heart of Jovial. Music is inherently social — Jovial makes that real.

# 

# \#### 🔹 Together Mode (2-Person Listening)

# 

# Together Mode is a private, intimate 2-person listening session where both users are perfectly synced to the same song at the same millisecond.

# 

# \*\*How it works:\*\*

# 

# ```

# User A                       Server (Socket.io)              User B

# &#x20; │                                  │                          │

# &#x20; │── Create Together Session ──────►│                          │

# &#x20; │◄─ session\_id + join\_link ────────│                          │

# &#x20; │                                  │◄── Join via link ────────│

# &#x20; │                                  │── Sync state to both ───►│

# \### 🔊 Feature 2: StereoLink — Dual Device Sync Speaker

# 

# StereoLink is Jovial's most technically innovative feature. It turns \*\*two smartphones into a stereo speaker pair\*\* — one device plays the left audio channel, the other plays the right channel, both perfectly time-synced over a local Wi-Fi network.

# 

# \*\*The Vision:\*\*

# 

# Place your phone and your friend's/partner's phone side by side. Both play Jovial. Tap "StereoLink". In seconds, your room transforms into a stereo sound system — music feels spatially wide, immersive, and powerful.

# 

# \#### How StereoLink Works — Step by Step

# 

# ```

# Step 1: Discovery

# &#x20;   Device A broadcasts a StereoLink beacon over local network (mDNS / UDP broadcast)

# &#x20;   Device B detects the beacon → "Jovial device found nearby: \[Device A]"

# &#x20;   User taps "Connect"

# 

# Step 2: Pairing \& Role Assignment

# &#x20;   Device A becomes the MASTER (left channel, controls playback)

# &#x20;   Device B becomes the SLAVE  (right channel, follows master)

# &#x20;   Both agree on a shared session token via WebSocket handshake

# 

# Step 3: Clock Synchronisation

# &#x20;   Master and Slave perform NTP-style clock sync:

# &#x20;     - Master sends T1 (send timestamp)

# &#x20;     - Slave records T2 (receive timestamp), sends T3 (reply timestamp)

# &#x20;     - Master records T4 (reply receive timestamp)

# &#x20;     - Offset = ((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) / 2

# &#x20;   Round-trip latency and clock offset are measured and compensated

# &#x20;   Sync accuracy target: < 20ms

# 

# Step 4: Playback Synchronisation

# &#x20;   Master plays ONLY the left audio channel (L channel extracted via Web Audio API)

# &#x20;   Slave plays ONLY the right audio channel (R channel extracted via Web Audio API)

# &#x20;   Master sends periodic "heartbeat" ticks with current track position\_ms

# &#x20;   Slave adjusts playback rate by ±0.1% to correct drift without audible glitching

# 

# Step 5: Drift Correction (ongoing)

# &#x20;   Every 5 seconds, master broadcasts authoritative position\_ms

# &#x20;   Slave compares with local position:

# &#x20;     - Drift < 20ms  → no correction

# &#x20;     - Drift 20–200ms → micro-adjust playback rate

# &#x20;     - Drift > 200ms  → hard seek to correct position (brief mute applied)

# ```

# 

# \#### StereoLink Technical Stack

# 

# | Component | Technology | Purpose |

# |---|---|---|

# | Device Discovery | mDNS (Multicast DNS) + UDP broadcast | Find other Jovial devices on LAN |

# | Signalling | Socket.io (WebSocket) | Session handshake + control messages |

# | Audio Splitting | Web Audio API (ChannelSplitterNode) | Extract L/R channels independently |

# | Clock Sync | NTP-inspired algorithm | Sub-20ms offset correction |

# | Drift Correction | AudioContext.playbackRate | Smooth micro-adjustments to fix drift |

# | Fallback | Web Audio API buffer offset | Hard seek with mute if drift > 200ms |

# 

# \#### StereoLink Modes

# 

# | Mode | Description | Use Case |

# |---|---|---|

# | 🔊 \*\*True Stereo\*\* | Device A = Left channel, Device B = Right channel | Side-by-side speakers |

# | 🔁 \*\*Mirror Mode\*\* | Both devices play full stereo, perfectly synced | Different rooms / louder playback |

# | 🔀 \*\*Swap Channels\*\* | Swap which device is L and which is R | Reposition speakers at any time |

# | 🔔 \*\*Solo Mode\*\* | Temporarily restore full stereo to one device | If partner steps away |

# 

# \### 📐 Full Request Flow — Together Mode Playback Event

# 

# ```

# 1\.  User A presses PAUSE on the player

# 2\.  React dispatch → Zustand playerStore.pause()

# 3\.  Socket.io emits: together:pause { sessionId, position\_ms, timestamp }

# 4\.  Server receives on /together namespace

# 5\.  Auth middleware validates session membership

# 6\.  RoomService updates Redis: session:{id}:state → { is\_playing: false, position\_ms }

# 7\.  Server broadcasts to room: together:state\_update { is\_playing, position\_ms, actor: "User A" }

# 8\.  User B's client receives event

# 9\.  Howler.js pause() called with seek(position\_ms) to guarantee sync

# 10\. User B's UI updates: pause button active, seek bar frozen at position\_ms

# 11\. User B sees "User A paused" toast notification

# ```

# 

# \### 📐 StereoLink Sync Request Flow

# 

# ```

# 1\.  Master plays track at position\_ms T

# 2\.  Every 5s: Master emits stereolink:heartbeat { position\_ms, clock\_ms }

# 3\.  Slave receives heartbeat

# 4\.  Slave calculates drift = (local\_position\_ms + network\_offset) - received\_position\_ms

# 5\.  If |drift| < 20ms    → No action

# 6\.  If 20ms < drift < 200ms → AudioContext.playbackRate adjusted ±0.1%

# 7\.  If drift > 200ms     → Hard seek + 200ms mute to avoid jarring pop

# 8\.  Slave sends stereolink:ack { slave\_position\_ms, drift\_ms }

# 9\.  Master logs sync health; if repeated large drift → notify user to move devices closer

# ```

# \### StereoLink Events

# 

# ```

# Client → Server:

# &#x20; stereolink:join         { session\_token, device\_name, channel }

# &#x20; stereolink:clock\_ping   { T1: timestamp\_ms }

# &#x20; stereolink:ack          { position\_ms, drift\_ms }

# &#x20; stereolink:mode\_change  { mode }       // "stereo" | "mirror" | "swapped"

# &#x20; stereolink:disconnect   { }

# 

# Server → Client:

# &#x20; stereolink:paired       { master\_device, slave\_device, mode }

# &#x20; stereolink:clock\_pong   { T1, T2, T3 }

# &#x20; stereolink:heartbeat    { position\_ms, clock\_ms, track\_id }

# &#x20; stereolink:sync\_warning { avg\_drift\_ms, recommendation }

# &#x20; stereolink:disconnected { device\_name }

# ```

# 

# \---

# 

# \## 🔊 Device Sync (StereoLink) — Technical Design

# 

# \### Clock Synchronisation Algorithm

# 

# StereoLink uses a 4-message NTP-inspired exchange to compute clock offset between master and slave:

# 

# ```

# Master                     Slave

# &#x20; │                           │

# &#x20; │── T1: ping ──────────────►│  (T1 = master send time)

# &#x20; │                           │  (T2 = slave receive time)

# &#x20; │◄─ T3: pong ───────────────│  (T3 = slave reply time)

# &#x20; │  (T4 = master receive)    │

# &#x20; │                           │

# &#x20; Offset = ((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) / 2

# &#x20; Latency = ((T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)) / 2

# ```

# 

# This exchange repeats 5 times on connect; median offset is used to filter outliers.

# 

# \### Audio Channel Splitting via Web Audio API

# 

# ```javascript

# // Master device — plays LEFT channel only

# const audioCtx     = new AudioContext();

# const source       = audioCtx.createMediaElementSource(audioElement);

# const splitter     = audioCtx.createChannelSplitter(2);

# const merger       = audioCtx.createChannelMerger(2);

# 

# source.connect(splitter);

# splitter.connect(merger, 0, 0);  // left  → left

# splitter.connect(merger, 0, 1);  // left  → right (mono-ify left)

# merger.connect(audioCtx.destination);

# 

# // Slave device — plays RIGHT channel only

# splitter.connect(merger, 1, 0);  // right → left

# splitter.connect(merger, 1, 1);  // right → right (mono-ify right)

# merger.connect(audioCtx.destination);

# ```

# 

# \### Drift Correction Strategy

# 

# ```

# Every 5 seconds:

# &#x20; Master → Slave: { position\_ms: 93450, clock\_ms: 1720000093450 }

# 

# Slave calculates:

# &#x20; expected\_position = received\_position\_ms + (local\_clock\_ms - received\_clock\_ms + clock\_offset)

# &#x20; actual\_position   = audioElement.currentTime \* 1000

# &#x20; drift             = actual\_position - expected\_position

# 

# Correction:

# &#x20; |drift| < 20ms   → no action (within acceptable range)

# &#x20; 20–200ms         → audioElement.playbackRate = 1.0 + (drift > 0 ? -0.001 : +0.001)

# &#x20; > 200ms          → audioElement.currentTime = expected\_position / 1000

# &#x20;                    (brief 200ms mute applied to mask seek pop)

# ```

# 

# \---

# 

# \## 🔐 Security

# 

# \### Input Validation

# \- All API inputs validated with Zod schemas on every route

# \- File uploads restricted to audio MIME types; size capped at 50MB

# 

# \### Rate Limiting (Redis-backed)

# | Endpoint Group | Limit |

# |---|---|

# | Auth (login/register) | 10 requests / minute |

# | Track streaming | 500 requests / hour |

# | Room creation | 5 rooms / day |

# | Search | 60 requests / minute |

# | StereoLink initiate | 10 sessions / hour |

# 

# \### Together Mode \& Room Security

# \- Session tokens are single-use UUIDs, expire in 24 hours

# \- Room invite links are rotatable by the creator at any time

# \- Socket.io events from non-members are silently dropped

# \- Room creator can kick users, which revokes their socket session immediately

# 

# \### Audio Streaming Security

# \- Cloudinary signed URLs for audio (expire in 1 hour, scoped to user)

# \- HLS chunked streaming to prevent direct file download

# \- Referrer validation on CDN to block hotlinking

# 

# \---

# 

# \## ⚡ Performance

# 

# \### Audio Streaming Optimisations

# \- \*\*HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)\*\* — Tracks segmented into 10-second chunks; client buffers 3 chunks ahead

# \- \*\*Adaptive bitrate\*\* — Automatically drops from 320 → 256 → 128 kbps on poor network

# \- \*\*Waveform pre-computation\*\* — Waveform amplitude arrays stored in DB at upload time; never computed on-the-fly

# \- \*\*Cloudinary CDN\*\* — Audio served from nearest edge node; average latency < 80ms globally

# 

# \### Real-Time Optimisations

# \- \*\*Redis as Socket.io adapter\*\* — Enables multi-instance horizontal scaling for rooms

# \- \*\*Room state in Redis\*\* — Sub-1ms state reads for heartbeat/sync events

# \- \*\*Event debouncing\*\* — Seek bar drag events debounced at 100ms before emitting

# \- \*\*Binary heartbeats\*\* — StereoLink heartbeats use compact binary frames (not JSON) for minimal latency

# 

# \### Caching Strategy

# | Data | Cache | TTL |

# |---|---|---|

# | Track metadata | Redis | 24 hours |

# | Search results | Redis | 5 minutes |

# | User profile | Redis | 1 hour |

# | Trending tracks | Redis | 10 minutes |

# | Room state | Redis | Active session only |

# | Lyrics | Redis | 7 days |

#

# \### Manual Production Build

# 

# ```bash

# \# Build client

# cd client \&\& npm run build          # outputs to client/dist/

# 

# \# Build server

# cd server \&\& npm run build          # compiles TypeScript to server/dist/

# 

# \# Start server

# cd server \&\& node dist/app.js

# ```

# 

# \### Production Checklist

# \- \[ ] Set `NODE\_ENV=production`

# \- \[ ] Configure Nginx reverse proxy with SSL (Let's Encrypt)

# \- \[ ] Use MongoDB Atlas with IP allowlist

# \- \[ ] Use Redis with password auth and TLS

# \- \[ ] Set `Socket.io` cors origin to your client domain only

# \- \[ ] Enable Cloudinary signed uploads in production

# \- \[ ] Configure Firebase FCM credentials

# 

# \---

# 

# \## 🔧 Troubleshooting

# 

# \### StereoLink won't connect

# \- Ensure \*\*both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\*\* — StereoLink does not work over mobile data

# \- Check that your router allows \*\*UDP broadcast\*\* (some mesh routers block this — try disabling AP isolation)

# \- If QR pairing fails, try entering the 6-digit code manually

# 

# \### Together Mode desync

# \- If drift exceeds 200ms repeatedly, try \*\*Resync Now\*\* button (bottom of Together Mode screen)

# \- Desync usually occurs on weak mobile data — a stable Wi-Fi connection is strongly recommended

# 

# \### Audio not playing

# \- Confirm Cloudinary keys are correct and the audio file was successfully uploaded

# \- Check browser console for CORS errors — ensure `CLIENT\_URL` in `.env` matches your client origin exactly

# \- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping` should return `PONG`

# 

# \### Rooms not showing real-time updates

# \- Socket.io requires sticky sessions if running multiple server instances — ensure the Redis adapter is configured

# \- Check that `VITE\_SOCKET\_URL` in client `.env` points to the correct backend URL

# 

# \---

# 

# \## ❓ FAQ

# 

# \*\*Q: Can I use Jovial with more than 2 devices in StereoLink?\*\*  

# A: Currently StereoLink supports a single pair (master + slave). Multi-speaker support (3+ devices) is planned for Phase 3 of the roadmap.

# 

# \*\*Q: Does Together Mode work over mobile data (not just Wi-Fi)?\*\*  

# A: Yes! Together Mode works over the internet via WebSocket — both users just need a stable connection. StereoLink, however, requires the same local network.

# 

# \*\*Q: How accurate is the audio sync in StereoLink?\*\*  

# A: After NTP clock synchronisation, typical drift is under 5ms. The drift correction system maintains < 20ms during normal playback. Occasional hard seeks may occur on very congested networks.

# 

# \*\*Q: Can room guests control playback?\*\*  

# A: Only the Room Creator and Co-DJs can control playback. Guests can send song requests, vote to skip (if enabled), and participate in chat.

# 

# \*\*Q: Is audio stored on Jovial's servers?\*\*  

# A: Audio files are stored on Cloudinary CDN. Serve your own licensed audio — Jovial does not provide a music catalog.

# 

# \*\*Q: Can I self-host Jovial?\*\*  

# A: Yes! The entire stack runs with Docker Compose. See the \[Deployment](#-deployment) section.

#

# 

# \## 📊 Design Decisions

# 

# \### Why Socket.io over raw WebSockets?

# 

# \- Built-in room/namespace management maps directly to Together Sessions and Listening Rooms

# \- Auto-reconnect and fallback to HTTP long-poll handles mobile network drops gracefully

# \- Redis adapter enables horizontal scaling across multiple server instances with zero code changes

# 

# \### Why MongoDB over PostgreSQL?

# 

# \- Track metadata, playlist tracks, and room queues have deeply nested, variable-length structures that map naturally to documents

# \- Atlas Search provides full-text search without needing a separate Elasticsearch instance

# \- Schema flexibility allows fast iteration on track metadata fields during development

# 

# \### Why Howler.js for audio playback?

# 

# \- Consistent API across all browsers and formats (MP3, OGG, AAC, HLS)

# \- Built-in Web Audio API integration for visualiser, crossfade, and channel manipulation

# \- Sprite support for low-latency sound effects (button clicks, notification sounds)

# 

# \### Why Redis for room state instead of MongoDB?

# 

# \- Room state (current position, is\_playing, queue) changes potentially hundreds of times per minute during active sessions

# \- Redis sub-millisecond writes and reads are essential for sync accuracy

# \- Pub/Sub lets the Socket.io Redis adapter broadcast room events to all server instances instantly

# 

# \### Why NTP-style sync over WebRTC for StereoLink?

# 

# \- WebRTC was evaluated but adds connection complexity (ICE, STUN, NAT traversal) that is unnecessary on a local network

# \- NTP over WebSocket achieves < 5ms offset accuracy — more than sufficient for audio sync on LAN

# \- WebRTC Data Channels are used as a fallback for sub-LAN scenarios in the roadmap

# \- \*\*Socket.io:\*\* Every event emitted from client must have a matching server handler and vice versa

# \- \*\*Tests:\*\* New Socket.io events require corresponding integration tests with mock client

# \- \*\*Audio code:\*\* Test StereoLink changes against known drift scenarios in `tests/stereolink/`

# \## 🎯 Final Words

# 

# \*\*Jovial\*\* was built out of the belief that music is one of the most powerful ways humans connect with each other — and that streaming platforms have left that connection on the table for too long.

# 

# Whether you're:

# \- 💑 A couple who wants to fall asleep to the same song from separate cities

# \- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 A group of friends hosting a virtual music night where everyone actually gets a say

# \- 🔊 Someone who wants their two phones to fill the room with real stereo sound

# \- 🎧 A solo listener who just loves the feel of swiping through music like a feed

# 

# \*\*Jovial is built for you.\*\*

# 

# > \*"Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything."\*  

# > — Plato
